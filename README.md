# bitshift-variations-rusted
Recreates Rob Miles' "Bitshift Variations in C Minor" in Rust, and provides the library and executable to convert the song to midi, as well as a 'humanized' C version of the original.

See the [project readme](https://github.com/Bitshift-Variations-Humanized/.github) for more details.

`cargo run --bin extract-notes` to generate the midi file
`cargo run` to run an executable that works exactly like the original, except it doesn't repeat infinitely
